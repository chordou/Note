    "Git is a distributed version control system, which means, different users can maintain the same project with different versions, which are called branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commit:  create a new version(snapshot) of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "HEAD is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit made on that branch. That means HEAD will be the parent of the next commit that is created. It’s generally simplest to think of HEAD as the snapshot of your last commit on that branch.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/advance-master.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "For more about branching, get it at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a commit from your files in workinig directory, three trees structure is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/reset-workflow.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "HEAD is the snapshot of your last commit on the current branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "INDEX(STAGE) is where you prepare your snapshots for the next commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working directory (also commonly referred to as the “working tree”) is where your edit your files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the working directory as a sandbox, where you can try changes out before committing them to your INDEX and then to HEAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic git workflow is as usual:\n",
    "* Modify files in your working directory.\n",
    "* Stage files, adding snapshots of files to your staging(index) area  for temporary saving.\n",
    "* Commit, which takes the files in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory. \n",
